## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create responsive HTML elements with CSS without using `@media` queries. New CSS functions such as `calc()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` makes it easy to write response CSS in a pretty easy way requiring less code. It literarily blew my mind ðŸ˜„.

This gave me a new way to look at CSS.

```CSS
.container h1{
  font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 2vw, 1.3rem);
}
```

I also learnt how to write markdown in VSCode... ðŸ˜¸

If you want more help with writing markdown, I'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

Just when I thought all was lost, these resources came to my rescue.

- [Web dev](<https://web.dev/articles/min-max-clamp#:~:text=Using%20the%20clamp()%20function,min(75ch%2C%2050%25)%3B%20>) - This helped me for setting responsive font-sizes, and `div` widths using `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` CSS functions. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Beatriz Caraballo](https://www.beatrizcaraballo.com/blog/responsive-text-squarespace) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand `clamp()` function. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
